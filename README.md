# MatchCaster — AI Football Commentary Engine

A fully local, multi-agent AI football commentary system. Replays real StatsBomb match data with live synthesized audio commentary from two AI commentators, displayed on an interactive pitch visualizer.

```
StatsBomb JSON → Replay Engine → Director (look-ahead batch) → LLM (Ollama)
                                                              → Piper TTS
                               → Analysis Engine
                               → WebSocket → React Frontend
```

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.11+ | [python.org](https://python.org) |
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Ollama | latest | `brew install ollama` |
| Piper TTS | 2023.11.14-2 | Standalone bundle — see Step 3 |

---

## Setup (one-time)

### 1. Start Ollama and pull the model

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama serve &               # start in background (or open Ollama.app)
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

### 2. Download match data

```bash
cd data
bash setup.sh
cd ..
```

Clones StatsBomb's open-data repository and copies match files into `data/matches/` and `data/lineups/`.

### 3. Download Kokoro TTS model files (optional — for higher-quality audio commentary)

> Without Kokoro, MatchCaster falls back to the macOS built-in `say` command automatically. Commentary still plays — just with system voices. Skip to Step 4 if you want to get started quickly.

MatchCaster uses **kokoro-onnx** for neural TTS (installed automatically via `pip install -r requirements.txt` in Step 4). It works on Python 3.13 and requires no binary — just two model files to download:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kokoro
cd ~/.local/share/kokoro

curl -L -o kokoro-v1.0.onnx \
  "https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/kokoro-v1.0.onnx"

curl -L -o voices-v1.0.bin \
  "https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/voices-v1.0.bin"
```

| Voice | Agent | Character |
|---|---|---|
| `am_adam` | Play-by-play | American male, energetic |
| `bm_george` | Analyst | British male, measured |

#### Verify:

```bash
python3 -c "
from kokoro_onnx import Kokoro
import subprocess, wave, io, numpy as np
k = Kokoro(
    model_path='$HOME/.local/share/kokoro/kokoro-v1.0.onnx',
    voices_path='$HOME/.local/share/kokoro/voices-v1.0.bin',
)
samples, sr = k.create('And we are off!', voice='am_adam', speed=1.1, lang='en-us')
pcm = (np.clip(samples, -1, 1) * 32767).astype(np.int16)
buf = io.BytesIO()
with wave.open(buf, 'wb') as wf:
    wf.setnchannels(1); wf.setsampwidth(2); wf.setframerate(sr); wf.writeframes(pcm.tobytes())
subprocess.run(['afplay', '-'], input=buf.getvalue())
print('Kokoro OK')
"
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

---

## Running the app

```bash
./start.sh
```

Starts both the backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 5173). Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

Open **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** in your browser.

> Run separately if preferred:
> ```bash
> # Terminal 1
> cd backend && python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
>
> # Terminal 2
> cd frontend && npm run dev
> ```

---

## Using the app

1. **Select a match** — the launch screen appears automatically. Pick a match, choose a commentary style, then click **Watch Live →**.

2. **Controls** — the video player bar at the bottom:
   - `▶ / ⏸` — play and pause
   - `−30s` `−10s` `+10s` `+30s` — jump backward or forward
   - Click the **seek bar** to jump to any point in the match
   - Speed buttons `0.5× 1× 2× 4× 8×` — control replay speed
   - `🔊` — mute/unmute audio commentary
   - `⚙` — open the **Overlay Panel** (pitch view and settings)
   - **Change** — go back to the match selection screen

3. **Overlay Panel** (opened with `⚙`):
   - **Live** — real-time event markers and pass trails on the pitch
   - **Formation** — starting lineup with jersey numbers and player names
   - **Heatmap** — territory map for home or away team
   - **Shots** — all shot locations, sized by xG, colored by outcome
   - **Build-up** — directional pass flow arrows by zone

4. **Sidebar tabs**:
   - **Stats** — momentum bar, possession, shots, xG, passes, fouls, cards
   - **Live** — key events feed (goals, cards, big chances) or full event log
   - **Squad** — starting lineup with positions and goal contributions

5. **Commentary styles**:
   | Style | Character |
   |---|---|
   | 🎙 Neutral | Balanced, professional |
   | 🔥 Enthusiastic | High energy, emotional |
   | 📐 Analytical | Tactical depth, data-driven |
   | 🏠 Home Fan | Biased toward the home side |
   | ✈️ Away Fan | Biased toward the away side |

## Architecture

### Commentary System

MatchCaster uses a two-commentator look-ahead batch system:

1. The **Director** pre-generates commentary for the next 30 game-seconds of upcoming events (before they happen on the pitch).
2. Each line is tagged to a specific event ID and TTS audio is synthesized in advance.
3. When an event fires on the pitch, its pre-synthesized audio plays immediately — perfectly synced.

**Play-by-Play commentator** — narrates the action. Fires every 30 game-seconds. Receives analyst context to weave into narration. Handles the opening scene-setter.

**Analyst commentator** — expert macro insights. Fires every 5-7 game-minutes, on substitutions, and 2 minutes after goals. Silent during the first 5 minutes (PBP owns the opening). Feeds context back to PBP.

| Piper TTS not installed | macOS `say` built-in voices |
| Piper TTS crashes | macOS `say` built-in voices |
